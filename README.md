# the-goodies-swift
Swift client implementation of the-goodies distributed MCP knowledge graph

Bertha is a simple test app that wraps the wildthing package

Inbetweenies is a Swift protocol package based on the Python https://github.com/adrianco/the-goodies/inbetweenies protocol

Wildthing is a client side package based on https://github.com/adrianco/the-goodies/blowing-off that depends on Inbetweenies to communicate with the Python based https://github.com/adrianco/the-goodies/funkygibbon server. For end to end testing, install and run the funkygibbon server.

Goal is to use the Inbetweenies and Wildthing packages once they are functional and tested, with the https://github.com/adrianco/c11s-house-ios app.
