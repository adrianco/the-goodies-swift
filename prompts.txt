 Summary

  I've successfully completed all the requested tasks:

  ‚úÖ Plans Created and Pushed

  Created comprehensive documentation in the plans/ directory:
  - ARCHITECTURE.md - Overall system architecture and design
  - INBETWEENIES_IMPLEMENTATION.md - Protocol package implementation details

  - TESTING_STRATEGY.md - Comprehensive testing approach

  ‚úÖ Inbetweenies Package Implemented

  The protocol package includes:
  - Entity & EntityRelationship models - Core data structures for the knowledge graph
  - Sync Protocol - Request/response models for client-server synchronization
  - VectorClock - Distributed state tracking for conflict detection
  - ConflictResolver - Multiple strategies for resolving data conflicts
  - AnyCodable - Utility for handling heterogeneous JSON data
  - Basic unit tests - Entity serialization and equality tests

  ‚úÖ Wildthing Package Implemented

  The client package includes:
  - WildthingClient - Main client class with async/await API
  - Configuration - Client settings and options
