npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "see the README.md, create a plans directory and write plans to build and test Swift versions of the fully tested Python code that is referenced there, push the plans to main, then implement the two packages and the test app. Push the code to main so it can be built and tested in Xcode on MacOS" --claude

Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Initialize swarm and analyze Python source code  
     ☐ Create plans directory and architecture documents
     ☐ Design Inbetweenies protocol package structure
     ☐ Design Wildthing client package structure
     ☐ Implement Inbetweenies protocol models
     ☐ Implement Wildthing client functionality
     ☐ Create comprehensive test suites
     ☐ Update Bertha test app integration
     ☐ Push plans to main branch
     ☐ Push implementation to main branch


 Now let me spawn the swarm agents and fetch the Python source code to analyze:
